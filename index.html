            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Hi!</b></p> 
            <p> I recently moved back to Auckland from 10 years living in London, UK. I'm currently working for Auckland Live 
                as an Audio Visual Technician. Most of my life I have worked with the technology that is used in the live events 
                industry. In my spare time I love to play music, snowboard, play PC games, fishing and socializing with friends and family</p>
            
                <p>I am currently working towards a career change to hopefully become a web developer. I have been coding as a hobby since 2020
                and I am working on a coding bootcamp with AUT/ Institute of Data this year</p>
